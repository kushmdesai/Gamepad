# Gamepad

Time spent making this:

## May 21 - finding out about Highway and starting the project

### Time spent: 3 Hours

I found out about the Highway to Undercity in the morning and decided that it would be really fun to do and signed up for it.

After I finished up with school that day I looked through [Highway.hackclub.com](https://highway.hackclub.com) and decided that it would be best to start of with a starter project and then work on a custom project. On the starter project page I only saw one option but as my current plan for the custom project was to make a custom keyboard and mouse I though that it was perfect that a hackpad was there.

I saw that they had a tutorial on how to make a hackpad on [hackpad.hackclub.com](https://hackpad.hackclub.com) and decided to follow it and see how to make one.

When I opened the tutorial it started off with making the pcb and this was new for me but I found it very intresting becasue I have some expeience with coding in languages such as Python, Js(I am currently learning it so I don't know that much but a bit), HTML, CSS. I also saw that it uses a software called [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org), which was new to me and I was excited to see how to make a pcb.

I followed the tutorial to make the schematic and at this point I thought that now that I made the schematic I will have to do the entire thing again but now as the pcb, but I was pleasantly when I found out that there was a button called convert schematic  to pcb. Although it is true that I still have to arrange it and do the wiring and I went through some trouble where I have to assign each part a footprint I have to admit I did have some fun doing this.

After I finished making the pcb I now had to make the case. I have used blender before but I thought that it would be extremly time consming to use that and to recieve the best help from the tutorial I decided to think about getting a free trial of [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/ca-en/products/fusion-360/personal).

### Things I Learned today

- I learned that there is something called Highway to Undercity
- I learned that I can make a custom and starter project
- I learned that theres something called Hackpad
- I learned Kicad
    - How to import libraries to Kicad
    - How to make a schematic in Kicad
    - How to make a pcb in Kicad
    - How to do wiring in Kicad

**Thats all for today see you tomorrow**
