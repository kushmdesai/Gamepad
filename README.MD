# Kush's Gamepad
This is pretty much just the four arrow keys but its on a board so its easier to game better! Here is how it will look...

I will use the M3x16mm screws, M3x5mx4mm heatset inserts do hold it together.

## And finally...

### The BOM

- The Seeed XIAO RP2040 cost $0.27 on AliExpress
- The Mx-Stlye Switches cost $4.08 on electromaker.io
- The sk6812 mini-e leds cost $2.46 on AliExpress

The total is around $6.81
This price is all for the number of required pieaces except the mini-e leds which are a 20x pack.
They are all without tax and shipping costs as well.
Also I am pretty sure that I didn't have to make a journal and everything since its a begenir project, but I just did for practice for when I do a custom project! :)
Lastly remember to leave back feedback on anything and/or everythinbg it would be greatly appreciated 

*Thanks in advance*
